Each exercise has been placed within seperate functions.

A button has been created for each exercise in the index.html file.

Loading the index.html file will reveal the button for each execise.

Clicking on a button with a certain exercise title will call the
appropriate function containg the code for that particular exercise.

This was done to make debugging easier, to make user interaction more
dynamic, and to get a head start on learning hot to get button to 
execute javascript code.
